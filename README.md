# ModernGLAbstraction
Low level OpenGL abstraction built upon [ModernGL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGL/ModernGL.jl).

**CAVEAT:** OpenGL is an ancient and ever-evolving standard/library. I am a single developer. *ModernGLAbstraction.jl* is part of a larger, enthusiastic game engine project. As such, it will flourish and grow as the overarching project evolves and my need for the various features of OpenGL expands. In other words: This is a heavy WIP project.
